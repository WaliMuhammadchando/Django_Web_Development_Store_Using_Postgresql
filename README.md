# Django_Web_Development_Store_Using_Postgresql
Welcome to the Django Web Development Store project! This repository contains the source code and resources for building a robust and feature-rich web application using Django, one of the most popular Python web frameworks, and PostgreSQL, a powerful open-source relational database management system.

Project Goals:

E-commerce Platform: Build a fully functional e-commerce web application where users can browse products, add them to their cart, and complete transactions.

Authentication and User Management: Implement user authentication, registration, and user profile management features.

Product Catalog: Create a dynamic product catalog with features like product categories, search, and sorting options.

Shopping Cart: Develop a shopping cart system that allows users to add, remove, and modify their selected items before checkout.

Order Management: Enable users to view their order history and track the status of their orders.

Admin Dashboard: Implement an admin dashboard for managing products, orders, and user accounts.

Payment Integration: Integrate payment gateways for secure and seamless online transactions.

Security: Ensure the security of user data and transactions through proper authentication, authorization, and encryption.

Scalability: Design the application with scalability in mind to accommodate a growing user base and product catalog.

Technologies Used:

Django: The core web framework for developing the application.
PostgreSQL: The database system for storing and retrieving data.
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript: Front-end technologies for creating a responsive and user-friendly interface.
Payment Gateway API (e.g., Stripe or PayPal): Integration for handling payments securely.
Django Rest Framework (DRF): Building RESTful APIs for frontend-backend communication.
Git: Version control system for collaborative development.
